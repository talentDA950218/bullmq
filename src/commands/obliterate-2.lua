    Completely obliterates a queue and all of its content

        ARGV[1]  cursor

-- This command completely destroys a queue including all of its jobs, current or past 
-- leaving no trace of its existence. Since this script needs to iterate to find all the job
-- keys, consider that this call may be slow for very large queues.

-- The queue needs to be "paused" or it will return an error
-- If the queue has currently active jobs then the script by default will return error,
-- however this behaviour can be overrided using the `force` option.

if rcall("HEXISTS", KEYS[1], "paused") ~= 1 then
    return -1 -- Error, NotPaused
end

-- 2) Check if there are active jobs, if there are and not "force" return error.
